# Brief
Your homework is to create the game Rock Paper Scissors game against the computer in the browser using alerts and prompts.

## What hasn't gone well

If you don't pay attention it looks like the game works fine. However there is something wrong with it that I need more time to fix. The computer will say that it has picked either rock, paper or scissors when the number bracket it's in says otherwise.

For example:
* I've set < 0.33 to equal rock. Yet in the game the computer will say it has picked scissors when the number it's generated is 0.24 (rock).

And it seems to be stuck on scissors once this happens.

Sometimes it will work correctly but sometimes the above happens.

## What went well

I'm generally pleased that I managed to get through the homework and unscramble in my head what had to be done and the logic to go through. I think I overcomplicated it in some areas but aside from the error mentioned above I'm happy with the result.
